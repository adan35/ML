Homework

Use our ANN model to predict if the customer with the following informations will leave the bank: 

Geography: France

Credit Score: 600

Gender: Male

Age: 40 years old

Tenure: 3 years

Balance: \$ 60000

Number of Products: 2

Does this customer have a credit card? Yes

Is this customer an Active Member: Yes

Estimated Salary: \$ 50000

So, should we say goodbye to that customer?
