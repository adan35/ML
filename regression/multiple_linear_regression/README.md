# Multiple Linear Regression

### Import Libraries

### Import Dataset

### Encoding categorical data

### Split the Dataset into the Training Set and Test Set

### Training the Multiple Linear Regression model on the Training set

### Predicting the Test set results

##### Making a single prediction (for example the profit of a startup with R&D Spend = 160000, Administration Spend = 130000, Marketing Spend = 300000 and State = 'California')

##### Getting the final linear regression equation with the values of the coefficients
